# Aspect-based-sentimental-analysis-on-Rulemaking-comments
General American public do have a say in the rule changes proposed by US Government authorities. These chaanges are put on a website (https://www.regulations.gov/) for the public to react and the authorities understanding how the people are feeling about the proposed changes. This project involves scraping such public comments on rulechanges about tobacco products. These public comments were then worked on my three annotators who classified the comments into three sentiments (positive,negative and neutral) and also identify the aspects in the text. A Cohen's kappa score was calculated to find the inter-relatability of the output from the three annotators. We aim to compare the results from running these data into machine learning models such as Naive-Bayes model, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest classifier and Logistic Regression. The experiment was run twice, first iteration with taking the best of the three annotator's decision as input and the other iteration where only one of the annotator's decision taken as input. The results are shown in the PPT.
